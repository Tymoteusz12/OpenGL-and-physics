Having fun with physics by learning OpenGL 

This is a Solar System replica with very close scale.

Camera moves with the Speed of Light, distances from the Sun are more or less exact. Planet scale is the same as real (compared to other object, orbits and space).
It is a project which mainly purpuse is learning OpenGL and train c++ programming.

Did not add the angles of inclination and declination for certain planets and Earth Moon. Saturn ring is just for visual purposes.
