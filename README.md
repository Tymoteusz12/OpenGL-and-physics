# OpenGL-and-physics
Having fun with physics by learning OpenGL 

In this repository I will submit projects written in C++ language. I'm using OpenGL to create pretty interesting physics simulations.

You can find here:

-Solar System replica (with almost exact scale, it's tremendous and amazing!)

-Rigid body simulations (soon)
